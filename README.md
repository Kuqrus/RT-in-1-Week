Officially supports Windows 10/11 and Visual Studio 2022, with more platforms coming soon. You'll need to have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) installed.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Kuqrus/RTinOneWeekend`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `RTinOneWeekend.sln` and hit F5 (preferably change configuration to Release or Dist first, Debug is slow)
